# FORKED! Credits Due
This is based on liveoverflow's browser exploitation series (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhixgUqwRTjwufDsT1ntgOY9yjZgg5H_t)

It is, of course, also based heavily on Linus Henze's exploit. Also included is a large chunk
of code from Niklas Baumstark, which is also featured in the liveoverflow video
(https://github.com/niklasb/sploits/blob/master/safari/regexp-uxss.html)


Besides this, of course, there are many bits of my own work & customizations.

# Patched or Not?
This is currently fully patched since iOS 12.1.1. This used to work on iOS (except the shellcode), macOS, and other places where webkit was used.

# Old README.md
To see the original readme, please see README.old.md . I thought it would be nice to still be able to hear details about the exploit from the time and person of discovery.
